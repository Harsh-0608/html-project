## ❓ Problem Statement
Every day, large amounts of edible food go to waste. Many people in need cannot access this surplus food. The aim of this project is to provide a simple and effective web interface to help connect food donors with receivers through a clean, responsive design.

## 🧩 Use Case
- **Donors**: Restaurants, individuals, or businesses with excess food.
- **Receivers**: NGOs, shelters, or individuals in need.
- **Admins**: To manage donor and receiver data.

## 📝 Problem Description
Despite having surplus food, there is no easy way to distribute it before it perishes. Our frontend provides an intuitive UI to allow donors to post available food and receivers to quickly claim it based on location and quantity.
