# ‚ôªÔ∏è ZeroWaste ‚Äì Geo-Intelligent Food Donation & Rescue System

## üìå Selected Domain:
**Social Good / Waste Management / Food Distribution**

---

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Every day, millions of tons of edible food are wasted, while millions of people remain hungry. A major barrier to effective food rescue is the lack of a simple, accessible, real-time system for connecting food donors (like individuals, restaurants, and stores) with receivers (such as shelters, NGOs, and individuals in need).

---

## üìù Problem Description

The current food donation processes are often manual, disorganized, or restricted to large institutions. There's a need for a **lightweight, location-based web platform** where:

- Donors can quickly post food availability.
- Receivers can request food without long procedures.
- Both parties can coordinate pickups based on **geolocation**.
- The process should be **mobile-friendly**, require **minimal setup**, and show **submission success instantly**.

---

## üí° Project Objective

The **ZeroWaste** project aims to build a clean, fast, and geolocation-powered platform that:

- Encourages **easy food donation** from individuals or organizations.
- Helps **receivers locate nearby donations** in real time.
- Enables location tracking using **HTML + JavaScript Geolocation API**.
- Displays **success feedback** after every form submission for clarity.
- Provides a structured foundation for future enhancements like admin panels and food distribution maps.
